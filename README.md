# connect4

## April 6, 2018

Our first assignment in Java. Lots of fun, plenty of memes (Connect 4 memes were trendy at the time). This was before we were introduced to the concept of OOP, so its awful spaghetti-code. Aside from that, its just a CLI version of Connect 4.

Now featuring Connect 4 2, a very cursed remake of the original written in about 2 hours by (ab)using Github Copilot to copy out the original source, while Kevin and I screamed in horror. It works, probably.
